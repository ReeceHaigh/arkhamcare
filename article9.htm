<p>At Arkham, we pride ourselves in operating the most advanced mental health research facility in the country. To that end, our research team of physicians and psychologists are building the future of cures, treatments and medicines for a variety of mental health disorders. We are dedicated to improving old methods from our storied history, and inventing new health care solutions to secure a resonant future in our field. Recently, we have reopened our Arboretum, where our scientists are making brilliant headway in discovering the medical usages of several natural plants. It's an exciting time to be at Arkham.</p>
