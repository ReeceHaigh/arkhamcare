<p>Quincy Sharp and Arkham Asylum are pleased to introduce the reopening of the Arkham Arboretum, a greenhouse and natural habitat that utilizes the healing powers of nature. &quot;The days of trapping our patients indoors are an antiquated notion,&rdquo; said Sharp. &ldquo;We are pleased to bring them out of the hospital and into a world of flora.&rdquo; The Arboretum is also a key component of Arkham&rsquo;s research efforts. &ldquo;We have found that plants might unlock the secrets to curing some of the minds greatest issues.&quot; While some patients prefer the pool and recreation room, there are some patients who have found the Arboretum irresistible.<strong></strong></p>
