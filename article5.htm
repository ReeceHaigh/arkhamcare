<p>To be diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) you must fit the diagnosis of the following six states.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Obsessions </strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Recurrent and persistent      thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced as intrusive and that      cause marked anxiety or distress.</li>
  <li>The thoughts, impulses, or      images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.</li>
  <li>The person attempts to ignore      or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with      some other thought or action.</li>
  <li>The person recognizes that      the obsessive thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her      own mind, and are not based in reality.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Compulsions</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Repetitive behaviors or      mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an      obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.</li>
  <li>The behaviors or mental acts      are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded      event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not      actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you exhibit any of these behaviors and they are causing pressure on you or your loved ones, don't be afraid to set up a consultation appointment. We're here to help.</p>
