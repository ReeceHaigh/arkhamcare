<p>The answer, of course, is yes. At Arkham, our patients are protected by one of the most advanced security systems in Gotham. We have more than 800 cameras in our facilities, and a staff of the finest trained security technicians ever assembled. We recognize that there is a difference between our voluntarily admitted patients and our committed ones, and we are dedicated to keeping both groups as safe and secure as possible, in order to ensure a safer Gotham.</p>
