<p>Elsa Stoddard, a 42-year-old mother of three children, was recently self-discharged from Arkham's Voluntary Rehabilitation Center after a brief, but rewarding three month stay. &quot;I honestly never thought I was going to get better,&quot; said Stoddard, &quot;but today, I can look back on an illness cured, and look forward to a life worth living.&rdquo; After experiencing several meltdowns that put her children in danger, Elsa's husband, Matthew, suggested she admit herself. But then things took a surprising turn. &quot;I saw her walk in, and despite her frail condition, I recognized her immediately as a fellow schoolmate from the class of &lsquo;85 at Gotham High,&quot; reflects Arkham resident doctor Jennifer Lowell. Through a series of intense regression therapies &ndash; and a mutual nostalgia for high school &ndash; Dr. Lowell helped Stoddard rediscover happiness. Said Stoddard: &ldquo;Having that sort of anchor from a happy time in my life helped me see the light.&quot; I owe my life to Dr. Lowell. Arkham cured me.&rdquo;</p>
