<h1>Arkham Care Prices</h1>
<p>Most hospitals believe you can't put a price on excellent mental health care. We at Arkham Care beg to differ. In addition to our award-winning baseline services, Arkham offers a wide range of upgradeable benefits, the perfect way to show a mentally ill loved one that you really care after all. These amazing add-on services are all part of what we like to call the Arkham Advantage.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Unfortunately, prisoners transferred to Arkham from Blackgate Prison are not eligible to participate in the Arkham Advantage. However, all Blackgate prisoners will receive the same basic care and attention that we give to all our residents. For more information on the tragic Blackgate fire, visit www.GothamCityMunicipal.com.<br />
</p>
<h2>Arkham Advantage- Plan I: $3,500</h2>
<p>Shock therapy is a time-tested technique for curing mental illness. Massage therapy is an ancient practice designed to relax the body. At Arkham, we have combined the two to create the world's first shock/massage hybrid therapy program, which our patients lovingly refer to as Shock and Awe. Have your loved one experience this groundbreaking therapy that heals the body and mind.<br />
</p>
<h2>Arkham Advantage- Plan II: $4,500</h2>
<p>For our patients accustomed to a higher standard of living, we offer the Pampered Prisoner. Indulge in a completely padded cell for maximum comfort. Lounge in the hand-crafted, 100-percent cotton Arkham designer uniform. Relax with restraints made of high-quality stainless steel surrounded by luxuriously soft velvet. You may have lost your mind, but you never have to lose your life of luxury.<br />
</p>
<h2>Arkham Advantage- Plan III: $5,500</h2>
<p>Since the 1950s, re-education has been used as an effective tool to cleanse the mind of impure thoughts and desires. However, re-education typically uses the same images, sounds, and films to reprogram the minds of all patients. At Arkham, we offer loved ones the unique opportunity to engage in selective re-education. You may handpick all media that your loved one is exposed to, or you may choose from several pre-approved Arkham themes. Themes include Loving Husband, Caring Father, Just Friends, or our most extensive theme, Blank Canvas. With Selective Re-Education, you can bring home the loved one that you always wanted.<br />
</p>
<h2>Complete Arkham Advantage: $12,150</h2>
